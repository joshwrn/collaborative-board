[Live Demo](https://scribble-ai-joshw.vercel.app/)

The initial purpose of this app was to mess around with an infinite canvas and resizable windows. It eventually evolved into a fun project I used to learn about AI and generative art.

I do not expect this app to be used for anything other than fun and learning. It is not intended to be used for commercial purposes.
